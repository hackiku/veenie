There's a reason pirates and cowboys are some of the most evergreen stories.

They move. And in doing so, they forge adventures and character. 

And yes, the economic case is there. And many of you will model it better than i will
(there's diminishing fun returns in programming a game).

holy cow... thanks! i spent the last 2 years studying and coding 24/7. the funniest part is that the #1 engineering variable that made me decide to pursue venus (sadly 3 months ago... cant do it all) is human nature - backpacking taught me people value industrial hands on work (and guilt free industrialization) and personal mobility. Thats why crammed mars habs will never really work. on venus everyone gets their airplane/balloon/glider. And its the best venue to "make space a place" with hard industrial work. 

theres a reason cowboys and pirates are evergreen storytelling — adventure, mobility, ship-like social structures (moving around venus, dipping down to collect ejecta). also designing aircraft for venus is an aero eng dream — its like early 60s but with AI assisted composite layup design. Ive sketched CO/CH4 air breathing engines and wild shit

plus the delta v advantage means we'll short-circuit
1) mining mercury for heavy metals
2) send fuel cheap-ish to earth orbit
3) learn atmo mining and speed up antimatter mining in jupiter rad belts

the funniest thing is that i feel driven to do this not by money and fame... i fell like backpacker me years ago. I just wanna travel and fly, and this gives me a venue to do it because if i dont nobody will. 

the problem is its a TON of work, but i think 400 dev hours should be enough to have a solid proto. I finally mastered svelte runes so im growing exponentially (incl. AI few shot prompting with elegant code samples) 

pls address all points!
